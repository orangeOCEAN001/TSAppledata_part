We will release the code and the complete dataset upon publication of the paper.

Between July and September 2024, the research team conducted multiple field visits to apple orchards in Shuimogou District, Ürümqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, to assemble a temporally and spatially diverse image dataset named the MultiApple Datasets. Temporally, the collection spans different phenological stages of apple development and various harvest times within the same day. Spatially, it encompasses varying occlusion scenarios and shooting distances. Using a HUAWEI nova 12 smartphone, 1,266 raw images were captured at a resolution of 3,000 × 4,000 pixels. After manual curation to remove duplicate or blurred images and subsequent downsampling, 1,078 high-quality apple images at 640 × 640 pixels were retained.
